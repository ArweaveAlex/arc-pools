It was important to ensure that information individuals were posting online were permanently stored so governments and other centralized entities could not censor it in the future.<br><br>Censorship during a time of war is undeniable, even more so when countries that already have mass control over what is said and written, are involved. It was inevitable that we would see high levels of censorship during this time.<br><br><b>The truth must be preserved, which is why this Archive was created. We want everyone to have their voice heard, so we and future generations can truly understand what has happened.</b>",
